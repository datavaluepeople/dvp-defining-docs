# Who are datavaluepeople

We are each one of:
- Partner: have legal ownership, long term committed to the goals and values, decide on the
  direction, projects, and development of dvp.
- Member: have 100% opportunity and access within dvp but require no upfront or continued
  commitment. When they choose to make commitments they honour them. They can work on projects and
  provide input to the direction and development of dvp, while slowly strengthening their
  relationship with dvp, with the hope of the partners that they eventually will want to become a
  partner.

There is a further category of _non-member_ or _freelancer_.
This category applies to someone who works with dvp on a project-by-project basis,
but has not become a member.

An example _journey_ for a newcomer could be performing a well-defined task for dvp, 
before then engaging with dvp on a longer project.
They are subsequently invited to become a member,
and if the relationship continues to grow may eventually become a partner.
