# Who are datavaluepeople

We are each one of:
- Partner: have legal ownership, long term committed to the goals and values, decide on the
  direction, projects, and development of dvp.
- Member: have 100% opportunity and access within dvp but require no upfront or continued
  commitment. When they choose to make commitments they honour them. They can work on projects and
  provide input to the direction and development of dvp, while slowly strengthening their
  relationship with dvp, with the hope of the partners that they eventually will want to become a
  partner.
