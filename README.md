# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## Purpose of this repo

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].

## Contributing

Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise. Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents page. Flat file structure over nested. Don't duplicate
information that already exists elsewhere.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

One approval is required, but the more the better, on any contribution PR. Any partner/member can
request a change approval to follow the legal governing document(s), i.e. Majority/Special
Majority.

## Purpose of datavaluepeople

The purpose of datavaluepeople is to enable its partners and members' work lives to achieve the
following:

2. To work on projects and stuff they are stoked (fired up) about working on
3. Have high level of ownership over their work, time, and energy
4. Be fun, enjoyable, and satisfying
5. Be low-mid stress

## Not purposes of datavaluepeople

These are things which are explicitly not the purpose of datavaluepeople:
