# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## Purpose of this repo

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].

## Who are datavaluepeople

We are a collection of people who collaborate to do applied machine learning, building automated
systems, advising, and educating, to create value for businesses, organizations, and humans.

We are each one of:
- Partner: have legal ownership, long term committed to the goals and values, decide on the
  direction, projects, and development of dvp.
- Member: have 100% opportunity and access within dvp but require no upfront or continued
  commitment. When they choose to make commitments they honour them. They can work on projects,
  input to the direction and development of dvp, while slowly strengthening their
  relationship with dvp, with the hope of the partners that they eventually will want to become a
  partner.

## Purpose of datavaluepeople

**The following purposes, not purposes, failure modes, and not failure modes, should inform all
decision making.**

The purpose of datavaluepeople is to enable its partners and members' work lives to achieve the
following:
1. To work with people they are stoked (fired up) about working with
2. To work on projects and stuff they are stoked (fired up) about working on
3. Have high level of ownership over their work, time, and energy
4. Be fun, enjoyable, and satisfying
5. Be low-mid stress

## Not purposes of datavaluepeople

These are things which are explicitly not the purpose of datavaluepeople:
- To generate money for partners/members
- To grow for growth's sake

## Explicit recognition of perceived failure modes

datavaluepeople is deemed a failure if it fails to achieve its purposes.

### Perceived failure modes
- Majority of partners fallout due to high stress project/commitments
- Majority of partners fallout due to high emotionally charged disagreements

### Not perceived failure modes
- Running out of money/having no work
    - Why: Individuals should go and get a contract/job as an individual
- Being sued
    - Why: We don't have any assets other than moderate cash in the bank

## Contributing to this repo

**Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise.** Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents page. Flat file structure over nested. Don't duplicate
information that already exists elsewhere.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

One approval is required, but the more the better, on any contribution PR. Any partner/member can
request a change approval to follow the decision making processes specified in the legal governing
document(s), i.e. Majority/Special Majority.
