# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## The purpose of this repo?

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].

## Contributing

Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise. Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents. Flat file structure over nested.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

Any partner can request a Special Majority requirement, as per legal governing documents, on any
contribution PR, otherwise only a single/few approvals required.

## Purpose of datavaluepeople

The purpose of datavaluepeople is to enable its partners and members' work lives to achieve the
following:
- Have high level of ownership over their work, time, and energy
- Be fun, enjoyable, and satisfying
- Be low-mid stress
- To work with people they are stoked about working with
- To work on projects and stuff they are stoked about working on

## Not purposes of datavaluepeople

These are things which are explicitly not the purpose of datavaluepeople:
- To generate money for partners/members
- To grow for growth's sake

## datavaluepeople principles and their trade-offs

- Never hire under a hard time pressure:
    - Why: Because who is in dvp is _the_ most important and defining thing so decisions on who to
      work with should never affected by external influence.
    - Downside: We have to turn down work if we don't have capacity.
- Always choose the most tentative low-commitment initial engagement possible:
    - Why: Engagements with clients/members/people we don't know have a lot of unknowns and thus
      high risk. Making a tentative/low-risk initial engagement is the best way to test if the
      engagement works.
    - Downside: We are slower entering and building engagements. Sales is harder if we're
      less/non-commital.
- Partners are equal:
    - Why: We believe ownership is integral to motivation, so we want all partners to have equal
      ownership.
    - Downside: Slower to make decisions. Possible deadlocks. Requires more energy in communication
      and more maintaining of relationships.
- Members have 100% opportunity but require 0% commitment:
    - Why: The people we want to be in dvp know their own worth. Such people don't like to be/are
      hard to constrained. We want to demonstrate we a collaborative group not an extractive one.
    - Downside: Members are a less reliable capacity for projects.
- We are fully remote by default:
    - Why: Goes without saying.
    - Downside: See the professed downsides by old large employers.
- We strive to work as asynchronously as possible:
    - Why: We believe this is more efficient, enables more diverse work styles, and makes for a
      more flexible work life and enjoyable life.
    - Downside: Requires more energy in communicating precisely. Potential members may not be used
      to working this way.
- We choose pragmatic win-wins over squeezing engagements for all we can get:
    - Why: Collaboration and mutual wins feel better, and we think give better returns for us in
      the long run.
    - Downside: We might earn lower rates than we otherwise could.
- We leave a wake/trail which others can take up:
    - Why: We want things we do to have lasting value, for that to happen things we do need to be
      able to be taken up by others (including our future selves), thus we leave our work in a
      comprehensible and accessible state.
    - Downside: It takes longer to build and create things, because we need to do extra work to
      make it readily continuable by someone else.
- We work in a lean minimal way:
    - Why: We don't know what will work/be of value or not, so we try lean experiments to learn as
      such quickly.
    - Downside: We may need to upgrade or even redo things we have previously build.
