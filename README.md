# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## The purpose of this repo?

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].

## Contributing

Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise. Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents. Flat file structure over nested.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

Any partner can request a Special Majority requirement, as per legal governing documents, on any
contribution PR, otherwise only a single/few approvals required.

## Purpose of datavaluepeople

The purpose of datavaluepeople is to enable its partners and members work lives to achieve the
following:
- Have high level of ownership over their work, time, and energy
- Be fun, enjoyable, and satisfying
- Be low-mid stress
- To work with people they are stoked about working with
- To work on projects and stuff they are stoked about working on

## Not purposes of datavaluepeople

These are things which are explicitly not the purpose of datavaluepeople:
- To generate money for partners/members
- To grow for growth's sake
