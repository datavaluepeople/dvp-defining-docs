# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## The purpose of this repo?

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].

## Contributing

Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise. Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/a contents. Flat file structure over nested. Don't duplicate
information that already exists elsewhere.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

One approval is required, but the more the better, on any contribution PR. Any partner/member can
request a change approval to follow the legal governing document(s), i.e. Majority/Special
Majority.
