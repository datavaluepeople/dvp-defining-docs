# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## The purpose of this repo?

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].
