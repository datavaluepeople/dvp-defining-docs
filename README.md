# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

## The purpose of this repo?

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from
[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aI_ywv-VXqnCAddv9bWmHjt0_msr3S4MmCe5nvH1jlM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Contributing

Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise. Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents. Flat file structure over nested.

datavaluepeople partners and members can contribute equally.

Partner contribution is expected, member contribution is heavily encouraged.

One or more approval is required on any contribution PR
apart from when a partner requests a [Special Majority requirement](legal_documents.md).
