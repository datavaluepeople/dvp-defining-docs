# datavaluepeople Defining Docs

We are a collection of people who collaborate to do applied machine learning, building automated
systems, advising, and educating, to create value for businesses, organizations, and humans.

## Purpose of this repo

To be the single source of information that defines how datavaluepeople operates, and enable the
partners and members to expand and progress these in an effective way.

This repo should replace the previous iteration of our defining docs from [Google Drive][link to
old docs].


## Purpose of datavaluepeople

**The following purposes, not purposes, failure modes, and not failure modes, should inform all
decision making.**

The purpose of datavaluepeople is to enable its partners and members' work lives to achieve the
following:
1. To work with people they are stoked (fired up) about working with
2. To work on projects and stuff they are stoked (fired up) about working on
3. Have high level of ownership over their work, time, and energy
4. Be fun, enjoyable, and satisfying
5. Be low-mid stress

## Not purposes of datavaluepeople

These are things which are explicitly not the purpose of datavaluepeople:
- To generate money for partners/members
- To grow for growth's sake

## Explicit recognition of perceived failure modes

datavaluepeople is deemed a failure if it fails to achieve its purposes.

### Perceived failure modes
- Majority of partners fallout due to high stress project/commitments
- Majority of partners fallout due to high emotionally charged disagreements

### Not perceived failure modes
- Running out of money/having no work
    - Why: Individuals should go and get a contract/job as an individual
- Extraordinary ruinous event
    - Why: We don't have any assets other than moderate cash in the bank

## Longer term vision

That datavaluepeople is composed of 10-20 individuals who are entrepreneurial in their own right,
each having a diverse network beyond datavaluepeople. They will collaborate on client projects,
for-profit and non-profit ventures, creating a dynamic and productive work environment.

## Contributing to this repo

**Contributions should aim to be concise first and foremost, then precise.** Rely on GitHub's file
explorer over maintaining links/contents page. Flat file structure over nested. Don't duplicate
information that already exists elsewhere.

Partners and members can contribute equally. Partner contribution is expected, member contribution
is heavily encouraged.

One approval is required, but the more the better, on any contribution PR. Any partner/member can
request a change approval to follow the decision making processes specified in the legal governing
document(s), i.e. Majority/Special Majority.
