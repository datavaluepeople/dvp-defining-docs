# Client project playbook

The following is advice for successfully delivering client projects. It should not include advice on
finding such projects, nor anything sales related.

## Before the project begins - client and project due diligence

Entering into contracts involves some risk. Entering into commitments that turn out to be far from
what we want or expected could cause us to fail (end operating, have a terrible time). We want to
minimise that risk while maintaining our ability to secure valuable projects.

- Can you include "trail periods" in the contract? I.e. for first 2 weeks can stop with 1 day
  notice.
- Have you met all/any of the people you will be working closely with? I.e. other developers.
- Have you seen all/any of code bases you will be working on?
- How much autonomy do we have in the project?
- How clear is the project?
- Have you made a rough initial roadmap for delivering the project?
- To what does the success of the project have (critical) dependencies are the client and their
  employees?
- Do you have any prior experience with the client, or can you get references for them?
- What is the client's current data maturity?
- How does the project contribute to the ascendant goals?
- How have you estimated the development time?

  - Have you added in a buffer? How much?
- Have you communicated the difference between a development time estimate and a commitment to
  delivering within a certain time?
- Have you added a buffer for after the agreed deadline to cover someone working any loose ends?

## During the project
- Most likely will want to have a weekly showcase with the client - that has proved very effective
  at a) keeping output momentum up, b) keeping the client up to date, c) keeping the work
  prioritised for the clients wants, d) discovering issues early.
- Get incremental sign off whenever possible, in email/formal way.
- Have discussion with client 4-6 weeks before the final deadline. This tees up a successful
  ending:
  - Reflect on the scope that was started out with.
  - Reflect on the work done.
  - Reflect on expectations on remaining work to be completed before the deadline given.


# Solo projects

These are project undertaken by a single partner or member of dvp.

Questions to ask:
- How do the individual decisions work with the group decisions?
- What happens if they make mistakes?
- Should the project be legally inside or separate from dvp?
