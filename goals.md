# Ascendant Goals

This document describes our ascendant - long term long game 3-5 year - goals.

The use of "flourish" is to embody ideas of biodiversity; sprawling, opportunistic, diverse,
changing, transient, resilient, naturally producing novelties, creating self-perpetuating positive
feedback systems.

### Flourish financially
###### Develop ability to gain resources fast or with little time-input so we have resource to invest into things we purely want to do

Likely KPIs for this: our total effective hourly rate, total money in the bank, time spent doing
exactly the work we want to, total passive income, backlog of available paid work/lead time for
securing paid work.

One way this goal could be achieved is if we are consistently breaking the linear scale of
increasing day rates. Some ideas for achieving this:
- Fixed fee projects we can do fast
- Performance based pay e.g. uplift-share
- Paid in equity of client companies, generating longer term returns
- Having built a product, SaaS or similar, which generates income


### Flourishing community
###### A strong self-sustaining diverse community that does satisfying work and has a great time

- Strong support and bonds within the group
- A diverse group with big diverse extended network
- Creating stable and successful dvp projects
- Pushing the quality and performance of the group
- Have some great times together


### Positive impact
###### Make far reaching and deep positive impact in the world

Measured on depth, scale, and duration
