# Ascendant Goals

This document describes our ascendant - long term long game 3-5 year - goals.


### work less for the man (wlftm)
###### Develop ability to gain resources fast or with little time-input so we have resource to invest into things we purely want to do

Likely KPI for this is our total effective hourly rate

Likely this goal will be achieved once we are consistently breaking the linear scale of increasing
day rates. Some ideas for achieving this:
- Fixed fee projects we can do fast
- Performance based pay e.g. uplift-share
- Paid in equity of client companies, generating longer term returns
- Having a built a product, SaaS or similar, which generates income


### dvp community
###### A strong self-sustaining community that ??? and have a great time

- Strong support and bonds within the group
- Creating stable and successful dvp projects
- Pushing the quality and performance of the group
- Have some great times together


### Positive impact
###### Make far reaching and deep positive impact in the world

Measured on depth, scale, and duration
