# datavaluepeople principles and their trade-offs

- Never hire under a hard time pressure:
    - Why: Because who is in dvp is _the_ most important and defining thing, so decisions on who to
      work with should never be affected by such external influence.
    - Downside: We have to turn down work if we don't have capacity.
- Partners are equal:
    - Why: We believe ownership is integral to motivation, so we want all partners to have equal
      ownership.
    - Downside: Slower to make decisions. Possible deadlocks. Requires more energy in communication
      and maintaining of relationships.
- Prolific in making connections but cautious in making commitments:
    - Why: The combination of the two will help us quickly, and in a low-risk way, find people and
      projects we're stoked about.
    - Downside: We are slower to grow. We spend time and energy on relationships and ideas that
      don't necessarily turn into concrete outcomes.
- Members have 100% opportunity but require 0% upfront commitment:
    - Why: The people we want to be in dvp know their own worth - they don't like to be
      constrained. We want to demonstrate we are a collaborative group not an extractive one. We
      want commitments to be entered into freely and thus with greater intrinsic motivation.
    - Downside: Members can't be upfront assumed as capacity for projects.
