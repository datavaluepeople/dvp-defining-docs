# datavaluepeople principles and their trade-offs

- Never hire under a hard time pressure:
    - Why: Because who is in dvp is _the_ most important and defining thing so decisions on who to
      work with should never affected by external influence.
    - Downside: We have to turn down work if we don't have capacity.
- Prolific in our engagements but careful in our commitments:
    - Why: The combination of the two will help us quickly, and in a low-risk way, find work and
      people we're stoked about.
    - Downside: We are slower to grow. We spend time and energy on "stuff" that isn't necessarily
      turn into a commitment
- Partners are equal:
    - Why: We believe ownership is integral to motivation, so we want all partners to have equal
      ownership.
    - Downside: Slower to make decisions. Possible deadlocks. Requires more energy in communication
      and more maintaining of relationships.
- Members have 100% opportunity but require 0% commitment:
    - Why: The people we want to be in dvp know their own worth. Such people don't like to be/are
      hard to constrained. We want to demonstrate we a collaborative group not an extractive one.
    - Downside: Members are a less reliable capacity for projects.
- Structure engagements with/within dvp to incentivise further investment and engagement.
    - Why: We don't want to create lock-ins, but we do want to foster deeper cooperation with
      partners/members/clients/partnerships. A main structural decision to achieve this are Project
      Pots.
    - Downside: Slower to form more reliable and strong collaborators.
- We are fully remote by default:
    - Why: Goes without saying.
    - Downside: See the professed downsides by old large employers.
- We strive to work as asynchronously as possible:
    - Why: We believe this is more efficient, enables more diverse work styles, and makes for a
      more flexible work life and enjoyable life.
    - Downside: Requires more energy in communicating precisely. Potential members may not be used
      to working this way.
- We choose pragmatic win-wins over squeezing engagements for all we can get:
    - Why: Collaboration and mutual wins feel better, and we think give better returns for us in
      the long run.
    - Downside: We might earn lower rates than we otherwise could.
- We leave a wake/trail which others can take up:
    - Why: We want things we do to have lasting value, for that to happen things we do need to be
      able to be taken up by others (including our future selves), thus we leave our work in a
      comprehensible and accessible state.
    - Downside: It takes longer to build and create things, because we need to do extra work to
      make it readily continuable by someone else.
- We work in a lean minimal way:
    - Why: We don't know what will work/be of value or not, so we try lean experiments to learn as
      such quickly.
    - Downside: We may need to upgrade or even redo things we have previously build.
