# datavaluepeople principles and their trade-offs

- Never hire under a hard time pressure:
    - Why: Because who is in dvp is _the_ most important and defining thing, so decisions on who to
      work with should never be affected by such external influence.
    - Downside: We have to turn down work if we don't have capacity.
- Partners are equal:
    - Why: We believe ownership is integral to motivation, so we want all partners to have equal
      ownership.
    - Downside: Slower to make decisions. Possible deadlocks. Requires more energy in communication
      and maintaining of relationships.
