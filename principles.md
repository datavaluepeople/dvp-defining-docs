# datavaluepeople principles and their trade-offs

- Never hire under a hard time pressure:
    - Why: Because who is in dvp is _the_ most important and defining thing, so decisions on who to
      work with should never be affected by such external influence.
    - Downside: We have to turn down work if we don't have capacity.
- Partners are equal:
    - Why: We believe ownership is integral to motivation, so we want all partners to have equal
      ownership.
    - Downside: Slower to make decisions. Possible deadlocks. Requires more energy in communication
      and maintaining of relationships.
- Prolific in making connections but cautious in making commitments:
    - Why: The combination of the two will help us quickly, and in a low-risk way, find people and
      projects we're stoked about.
    - Downside: We are slower to grow. We spend time and energy on relationships and ideas that
      don't necessarily turn into concrete outcomes.
- Members have 100% opportunity but require 0% upfront commitment:
    - Why: The people we want to be in dvp know their own worth - they don't like to be
      constrained. We want to demonstrate we are a collaborative group not an extractive one. We
      want commitments to be entered into freely and thus with greater intrinsic motivation.
    - Downside: Members can't be upfront assumed as capacity for projects.
- Structure engagements with/within dvp to incentivise (but not force) further investment and
  engagement:
    - Why: We don't want to create lock-ins, but we do want to foster deeper cooperation with
      partners/members/clients/partnerships. A main structural decision to achieve this are Project
      Pots.
    - Downside: Slower to form more reliable and strong collaborators.
- Fully remote by default:
    - Why: We want to work with anyone regardless of location or borders.
    - Trade-off: Takes more effort to hang out, especially in person.
- We choose pragmatic win-wins over squeezing engagements for all we can get:
    - Why: Collaboration and mutual wins feel better, and we think give better returns for us in
      the long run.
    - Downside: We might earn lower immediate returns than we otherwise could.
- We leave a wake which is a joy for others to take up:
    - Why: We want things we do to have lasting value, for that to happen things we do need to be
      able to be taken up by others (including our future selves), thus we leave our work in a
      comprehensible and accessible state.
    - Downside: It takes longer to build and create things, because we need to do extra work to
      make it readily continuable by someone else.
- We work in a lean minimal way:
    - Why: We don't know what will work or be of value, so we try lean experiments to learn
      quickly.
    - Downside: We may need to upgrade or even redo things we have previously built.
- When doing development, we put reviewers before writers:
    - Why: Builds a dev culture that is a joy to work in, pushes each other to excel, ensures
      higher code quality and maintainability.
    - Downside: Writing code takes longer.
