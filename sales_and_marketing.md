# Sales and marketing

- **Sales**: closing deals and generating revenue through direct interaction with 
  customers.
- **Marketing**: a broader approach, creating awareness, building relationships, and 
  driving long-term sales growth.

This page focuses on the latter with it being assumed that members switch into _sales 
mode_ when needed.

## Mindset

Both the arrival of prospects and their conversion are highly stochastic processes, 
and more driven by factors outside our control than project work. We prioritise 
efforts that continue to increase the likelihood of being found / finding opportunities 
and bring us value over time, rather than efforts that only produce results in the 
moment â€” for example, writing blog posts is better than cold emailing.

## Network

Connections are formed at the personal level and individual members should actively 
maintain and expand their own networks. Checking in on a regular basis with existing 
contacts is as important as making new ones.

## Online presence

Durable high-quality content online is key to our marketing.
- Our website, https://datavaluepeople.com: the central portal for our brand. 
- Online profiles and content directly related to members, e.g. LinkedIn, StackOverflow...

There should be uptodate content on our website covering the following areas.
- Who we are and how we work
- Project examples and testimonials
- Case studies to highlight what we can offer
- Blog posts to demonstrate technical understanding, amongst other things

Smaller content can be posted on other channels, such as LinkedIn, ideally with a link 
back to longer content on the website.
