# Financials

The dvp accounting system, `tracula`, should be referred to as the ground-truth for __all__ things
financial.

## Rough specification

The following is a rough specification, which may contain incorrect/out of date information. It is
included to give new/potential members an easily gained rough overview of how they can expect
financials work.

- You get paid based on the time you work
  - We are accurate with our recorded worked time
  - A major part of the value we deliver is solving hard problems, so we bill for thinking time
- Each project has a specified hourly rate
- Everyone is paid the same project rate
- Partners and members are responsible for (saving for) their own tax liabilities
- 15% of Partner/Member income is directed into their person-specific Project Pot
- Project Pots are person-specific pots of funds that Partners/Members can pay themselves the
  dvp-Project rate for working on things they want to do
    - Examples of dvp-Projects; open source development, working with non-profits, dvp-admin, dvp
      internal tools, business dev, writing blog posts, travel and expenses for dvp meet ups, kinda
      anything that the team generally agrees is good stuff to do
