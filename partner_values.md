# Partner values

Things we explicitly value, strive for, and look for in partners:

#### Honesty
Everything that everyone says is what they mean and understand to be true so far as they know. We
rely much more on built up trust and relationships than legal contracts.

#### Emotional intelligence
We value emotional intelligence - the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in
positive way, to communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges, and defuse
conflict. We believe this is a key requirement in doing meaningful work that involves any
collaboration. We proactively invest in and work on our own emotional intelligence, and see it as
continual learning process.

#### Humbly empirically-driven
We value science and data-driven decision making, but we appreciate and know how little we know, we
are cautious in being "sure" we're right, we are open to being wrong, and we strive to learn from
outside of our past spheres of learning.
