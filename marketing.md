# Marketing (and sales)

## Sales and marketing

This page concerns sales in the sense of bringing in new projects,
but is technically more concerned with marketing to attract clients organically.
When members find themselves needing work, it is natural for them to shift into _sales mode_.
However, here we talk about ongoing activity to avoid such situations.

## Mindset

Both the arrival of prospects and their conversion are highly stochastic processes,
and more driven by factors outside our control than project work.
We invest our energy in increasing the likelihood of being found/finding opportunities beyond the period of action.

## Network

Connections are formed at the personal level 
and individual members should actively maintain and expand their own networks.
Checking in on a regular basis with existing contacts is as important as making new ones.

## Online presence

Our website is the central portal for our brand.
There should be uptodate content covering the following areas.
- Who we are and how we work
- Project examples and testimonials
- Case studies to highlight what we can offer
- Blog posts to demonstrate technical understanding, amongst other things

Smaller content can be posted on other channels, such as LinkedIn, 
ideally with a link back to longer content on the website.
